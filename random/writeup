- in this challenge, a "random" number is generated and XOR with user input. The result 
	is compared with 0xdeadbeef and if they match, the program output flags. 
- however in c program's rand(), if we do not provide it a seed it will always output 
	the same set of random numbers and they do not change. In that case, the outcome of 
	rand() will depend on the environment program runs on. 
- since the rand() result is 0x6b8b4567 on the server, 0x6b8b4567 XOR 0xdeadbeef is 
	0xb526fb88 = 3039230856. 
- A: 3039230856
