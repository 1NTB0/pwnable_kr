- strings flag to get all the strings contained in the packed binrary. Looking for clue.
- find suspecious string, e.g. "upx packer..."
- <upx -d flag> to unpack the binary
- examine the code just like usualy, and the flag is manipulated right before strcpy(). 
- A: UPX...? sounds like a delivery service :)
